Mission
=======

While watching Star Trek TNG for my geek studies, I noticed how central the simple
starfield simulation effect is for the series. They have some small variations,
such as drawn-out stars due to "warp speed" and a camera pointing in a different
direction than it is traveling.

I realized that while I have made several renditions of the effect, I have never
added any extra effects such as these. I hereby pick up my old demo scene skillz
and accept this challenge I have given myself.
